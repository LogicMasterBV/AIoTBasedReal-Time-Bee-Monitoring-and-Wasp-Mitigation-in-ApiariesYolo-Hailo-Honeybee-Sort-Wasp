This project presents a real-time, AI-driven system designed to autonomously detect and deter wasps in proximity to beehives using embedded edge computing. The system leverages a Raspberry Pi 5 in conjunction with a Hailo-8 AI accelerator (26 TOPS) to deploy a custom-trained YOLOv11n object detection model. It is capable of distinguishing between bees and wasps with high precision, ensuring that deterrent actions are species-specific and non-invasive.

The architecture integrates computer vision, object tracking, and actuation logic through a dual-axis servo turret equipped with a Class 3B laser module. Target selection is governed by a lock-on mechanism requiring a wasp to remain within a defined spatial zone for a continuous 0.5-second duration before laser activation. Tracking is handled via a lightweight implementation of the SORT algorithm, and actuation is managed using a PCA9685 PWM driver and IRLZ44N MOSFET for laser control.

The system was developed in Python and tested under constrained embedded conditions, demonstrating reliable detection performance (~60 FPS), mechanical stability, and species-selective targeting. This work contributes to the development of precision ecological protection tools and highlights the feasibility of deploying advanced AI models on low-power embedded platforms for environmental applications.
